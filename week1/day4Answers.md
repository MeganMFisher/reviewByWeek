    //<h1></h1>  <p></p>  <section></section>  <header></header>

// How are IDs and classes different?

    //Classes are reusable and able to be used on multiple html tags to give them all the same stying. IDs are unique and specific to one tag. You don't reuse them.

    //!important. However do your best to not need these because you should be writing your code in a way you rarely need them.
    
// Is order important in the css file?

    //CSS stands for cascade style sheet. If the styles are equal in value it will use the last one on the page over the first. It will take the most recent reference to it. As long as specificity is the same on each of them.

// How do you reference classes, ids, and elements in your stylesheet?

    // header { }//element itself

    // .main-header { }//class

    // #header1 { }//ID

    
//Between margin and padding which one impacts what is inside the element and which will impact was is on the outside of the element?

    // Margin impacts anything outside of the container 
    // Padding impacts the inside of the container
