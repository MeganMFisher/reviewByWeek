// What are media queries?

    // It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true. The @media rule is used to define different style rules for different media types/devices.

    // Media queries are useful when you want to apply specific CSS styles that depend on the general type (such as print vs. screen), specific characteristics (such as the width of the browser viewport), or environment (such as ambient light conditions) of a device. As the number and variety of internet-connected devices continue to expand, media queries are becoming increasingly vital for building robust websites and apps.
    
    
// Why should you design mobile first when using media queries?

    //If you design for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device, it will make the page display faster on smaller devices.
    
    
    
// How do you create a breakpoint?

    // We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.

    //@media(<set your condition in here>) {}

    //@media(min-width:750px) {
        //750px or greater
    //}
