//// CLOSURES

// What can functions return?



// What is a closure?





// Give an example of a closure?





// What is the difference between ++num and num++?




// Make the following code work:

    // let add = mathStuff(10)
    // add(10) // returns 20



// What are the benefits of using a closure?



// Use closure to create a function that will take a pizza order.




// MODULE PATTERN

// What is the module pattern?



// Write an example of the module pattern?



// Create a calculator using closures and the module pattern.




//// CONTEXT 

// What is context?

    // Context is the surrounding information that gives understanding and clarity.



// What are 3 ways to determine context?




// What is implicit context?




// How do you use explicit context?




// What will be the value of the code below when uncommented?

    let dog = {
      color: 'white',
      age: 8,
      energy: 4,
      description: function() {
        return `This dog is ${this.color}, is ${this.age} years old, and has a ${this.energy > 5 ? 'high' : 'low'} energy level.`
      }
    }

    // dog.description()




// What will be the value of this code below when uncommented?

    let description = dog.description
    // description() 




// What would happen if I added 3 global variables named color, age and energy?





// What is the order of priority when defining 'this'?




// What will be the value of the code below?

    let implicit = {
        value: 'hi',
        sayHi: function() {
            return this.value
        }
    }

    let newValue = { value: 'heeeeeyyyy' }

    let explicit = implicit.sayHi.bind(newValue)
    // explicit()



//// CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS 

// Write a basic class function?


// A car object builder example as just a function.

// Now a constructor function.

    function Car() {
      // 'this' refers to the new object that is being constructed.
      // we are using dot notation to add make & model properties to the new object.
      
      // this = {} <--- IMPLIED
        console.log(this)
        this.make = 'Ford'
        this.model = 'Mustang'
        console.log(this)
      // return this <-- IMPLIED
      
      // The new object gets automatically returned, we don't need to use a return statement.
    }

    // Using the 'new' operator builds an new instance of an object (blueprint for object  contained in the function)
    // 'new' also sets the context for the 'this' keyword.
    // let mustang = new Car();




// What happens when you don't use the 'new' keyword?




//// PROTOTYPES 

// Review of prototypes on classess.




// What happens when you code a method inside a constructor function?




// Write an example of a prototype on an array that returns the first item in the array.





//// ARROW FUNCTIONS

// How do arrow functions handle 'this'?
    
    // An arrow function's 'this' takes on the value of what 'this' would be in itâ€™s surrounding scope at the time that it was created as opposed to the time that it was invoked like other functions (because of this, explicit binding will never work).



// Paste this code in your console and invoke the method 'context':

    let notArrow = {
      context: function() {
        return this
      }
    }

// What was the value?





// Now paste this code in the console and invoke the method 'context':
 
      let arrow = {
        context: () => {
          return this
        }
      }




// What was the value?





// What will be the value of the code below when it's pasted in the console and why?

    let nestedArrow = {
        value: 'abc',
        createArrow: function() {
            return () => this;
        }
    }
    let arrowFn = nestedArrow.createArrow()
    // arrowFn()




// What will be the value of this code below and why?

    let removedFunction = nestedArrow.createArrow
    // removedFunction()



// What is the difference between and arrow function and a regular function when it comes to context?
