//// CLOSURES

// What can functions return?

    // All the things including functions.



// What is a closure?

    // A function that returns another function.

    // An outer function that returns an inner function. That inner function has access to all the variables that existed in it's lexical environment.

    //The inner function will then remember all the variables it had access to within the outer function even after the outer function has been invoked. 

    // A function within another function.

    // Takes a snapshot of its scope or lexical environment at the time it is invoked. 
    


// Give an example of a closure?

    function closure() {
      let num = 0;
      return function() {
        return ++num
      }
    }

    let one = closure()
    one()
    let two = closure()
    two()
    two()
    two()



// What is the difference between ++num and num++?

    // ++ before will increment the value and then return.

    // ++ after will return the value then increment it.





// Make the following code work:

    function mathStuff(num) {
      return function(num1) {
        return num1 + num;
      }
    }

    // let add = mathStuff(10)
    // add(10) // returns 20




// What are the benefits of using a closure?

    // It allows us to keep private variables and public variables. 

    // It is a more controlled environment.

    // Prevents potential bugs and issues in your code because you aren't using global variables.

    // Keeping your code DRY.





// Use closure to create a function that will take a pizza order.

      function pizzaOrder() {
        let toppings = []
        return function(top) {
          toppings.push(top)
          return toppings
        }
      }

      let james = pizzaOrder()
      james('all the things')





// MODULE PATTERN

// What is the module pattern?

    // Allows us to use public and private methods & variables along with shielding parts of our code from the global scope.

    // Example: Private function invoked by the public one.

    // Limited access and very controlled. 

    // The only difference is returning an object with methods rather than returning a function.




// Write an example of the module pattern?

    function closuring() {
      let privateVar = 'this is private'
      function privateFn(str) {
        privateVar = str
      }

      return {
        write: function(str) {
          privateFn(str)
        },

        read: function() {
          return privateVar
        }

      }
    }

    let publicWord = closuring()
    publicWord.read()

    publicWord.write('changed')
    publicWord.read()




// Create a calculator using closures and the module pattern.

    function calculator() {
      let value = 10

      return {
        add: function(num) {
          return value += num 
        },
        subtract: function(num) {
          return value -= num 
        },
        divide: function(num) {
          return value /= num 
        },
        multiply: function(num) {
          return value *= num 
        }
      }
    }
    
    let calc = calculator()
    calc.divide(2)





//// CONTEXT 

// What is context?

    // Context is the surrounding information that gives understanding and clarity.

    // 'this' will always be an object. If it is not it will break.



// What are 3 ways to determine context?

    // Explicit
    // Implicit
    // Default

    // It will first look for explicit context to give the value to 'this' it will then go to implicit then default. 

    // Default is the window. We don't want that.

    // Be sure to always use explicit or implicit context. 



// What is implicit context?

    // Whatever is left of the dot when the function is invoked. Doesn't matter where it is declared, defined or where the function lives it only matters when it is invoked.



// How do you use explicit context?

    //.call(), .apply(), .bind()

    function binding() {
      return this 
    }

    let value = {
      num: 123453
    }

    let newBinding = binding.bind(value)
    newBinding()




// What will be the value of the code below when uncommented?

    let dog = {
      color: 'white',
      age: 8,
      energy: 4,
      description: function() {
        return `This dog is ${this.color}, is ${this.age} years old, and has a ${this.energy > 5 ? 'high' : 'low'} energy level.`
      }
    }

    // dog.description()


    // 'This dog is white, is 8 years old, and has a low energy level.'

    // Because the context being used here is implicit. Since there is an object left of the dot.




// What will be the value of this code below when uncommented?

    let description = dog.description
    // description() 

    // 'This dog is undefined, is undefined years old, and has a low energy level.'

    // This is using the default context and there is no color, age, or energy properties on the window. 




// What would happen if I added 3 global variables named color, age and energy?

    let color = 'black'
    let age = 12
    let energy 12

    // description() 

    // 'This dog is black, is 12 years old, and has a high energy level.'

    // It is using default context to get the value of this off the window context. 





// What is the order of priority when defining 'this'?

    // Explicit
    // Implicit
    // Default




// What will be the value of the code below?

    let implicit = {
        value: 'hi',
        sayHi: function() {
            return this.value
        }
    }

    let newValue = { value: 'heeeeeyyyy' }

    let explicit = implicit.sayHi.bind(newValue)
    // explicit()


    // 'heeeeeyyyy'

    // Because even though there was a value on the original object when we invoked it we bound it to the newValue and that takes precident. 





//// CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTIONS 

// Write a basic class function?

    class Betty {
      constructor() {
        this.age = 23
      }
    }

    new Betty;

    // A class is basically a constructor function.




// A car object builder example as just a function.

    function carBuilder(make, model) {
      let car = {}
      car.make = make;
      car.model = model;
    }

    carbuilder('Toyota', 'Matrix')




// Now a constructor function.

    function Car() {
      // 'this' refers to the new object that is being constructed.
      // we are using dot notation to add make & model properties to the new object.
      
      // this = {} <--- IMPLIED
        console.log(this)
        this.make = 'Ford'
        this.model = 'Mustang'
        console.log(this)
      // return this <-- IMPLIED
      
      // The new object gets automatically returned, we don't need to use a return statement.

      // If you add return to a constructor method you will not get what you think and it will break things. 
    }

    // Using the 'new' operator builds an new instance of an object (blueprint for object  contained in the function)
    // 'new' also sets the context for the 'this' keyword.
    // let mustang = new Car();




// What happens when you don't use the 'new' keyword?

    // With constructor function you put the properties on the window object instead of the 'this' object. 

    // If you don't use a new keyword with classes it will just break. 




//// PROTOTYPES 

// Review of prototypes on classess.

    // Anytime you write a function inside of a react class you are writing a prototype. 

    // Prototype methods will allow us to have one copy of it. It is a way to keep your code dry. 

    // Prototype is an object that is accessible to all the things. .push(), .slice() etc are all methods on the prototype object. 

    // Really great way to save on memory. 



// What happens when you code a method inside a constructor function?

    //Good practice to capitalize the name but not required.

    function WithMethod() {
 
    }

    WithMethod.prototype.fn = function() {
        return 'cool'
      }

    let vari = new WithMethod()
    vari.fn()

    //'cool'

    let vari = new WithMethod()
    let vari2 = new WithMethod()
    vari.fn === vari2.fn
    // false



// Write an example of a prototype on an array that returns the first item in the array.


    Array.prototype.newFn = function() {
      return this[0]
    }

    let arr = [1,32,5]

    arr.newFn()





//// ARROW FUNCTIONS

// How do arrow functions handle 'this'?
    
    // An arrow function's 'this' takes on the value of what 'this' would be in itâ€™s surrounding scope at the time that it was created as opposed to the time that it was invoked like other functions (because of this, explicit binding will never work).



// Paste this code in your console and invoke the method 'context':

    let notArrow = {
      context: function() {
        return this
      }
    }



// What was the value?

    notArrow.context() // notArrow {}
 


// Now paste this code in the console and invoke the method 'context':
 
      let arrow = {
        context: () => {
          return this
        }
      }

// What was the value?

    arrow.context() // window

    Arrow functions don't care about the context.




// What will be the value of the code below when it's pasted in the console and why?

    let nestedArrow = {
        value: 'abc',
        createArrow: function() {
            return () => this;
        }
    }
    let arrowFn = nestedArrow.createArrow()
    // arrowFn()

    //{ value: 'abc', createArrow: [Function] }





// What will be the value of this code below and why?

    let removedFunction = nestedArrow.createArrow
    // removedFunction()

    // [Function]



// What is the difference between and arrow function and a regular function when it comes to context?

    // With an arrow function the context of that function is determined wherever the function is declared which is different from a regular function which context is determined where the function is invoked.
